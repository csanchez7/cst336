                An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer 
                hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs.

                An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer 
                hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs.

                Time-sharing operating systems schedule tasks for efficient use of the system and 
                may also include accounting software for cost allocation of processor time, mass storage, 
                printing, and other resources.

                For hardware functions such as input and output and memory allocation, the operating system 
                acts as an intermediary between programs and the computer hardware, although the application 
                code is usually executed directly by the hardware and frequently makes system calls to an OS 
                function or is interrupted by it. Operating systems are found on many devices that contain a 
                computer â€“ from cellular phones and video game consoles to web servers and supercomputers.
