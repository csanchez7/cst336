                What are Operating Systems?
                </h2>

                <p>
                Operating systems are the system software that allow us to utilize computer hardware through 
                applications, services, and other software.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                Operating systems contain programs that allow us to schedule tasks for effective and efficient use of the hardware. 
                This may include accounting software for usage of processors, storage, 
                and other resources.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                The operating system also acts as an middle man between programs and the computer hardware. 
                Though application code is usually executed directly by the hardware and frequently makes system calls to the OS, 
                this aspect can often be controlled by the user. Operating systems can be found on a variety of devices from phones and 
                video game consoles to supercomputers and servers.
