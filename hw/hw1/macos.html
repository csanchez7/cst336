               The Macintosh Operating System, though not the first to have one, popularized the GUI along with the point and click system.
               It came with all of the Macintosh computers of its era and has been included with every Macintosh computer since.
               Many updates to the system software were done in conjunction with the introduction of new Macintosh systems.

               The first Macintosh was released January 24, 1984 and the first version of the OS
               system software, which had no official name, had its basis in the Lisa OS, that was included with the
               Lisa computer in 1983.
